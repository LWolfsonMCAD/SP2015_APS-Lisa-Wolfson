#*Lisa Wolfson* Project Learning Plan Draft (6/14/15)

##Project Title
*The Foundations of Responsive Design and Best Practices for Applying Those Techniques to the Design and Development Process.*

##Total Project Deliverable Summary
By the end of this class, I will be able to demonstrate that I fully grasp the fundamentals of responsive design, and how it plays into/affects the development process, by creating a working version of a site that is fully responsive between desktop, tablet and mobile platforms.

##Technology List
While I am positive there are applications and programs that I will need to add to this list, that will specifically help with responsive design (i.e. â€“ a program that allows you to make sure the code/site accurately checks for other display platforms while working on a computer), here are the programs I know of thus far:

* Adobe InDesign : used for any site mockups needed.
* Adobe Photoshop : used for any image editing, as well as color sampling.
* GitHub : file sharing and site repository so my professor and peers can easily see my code, recreate my site locally, and offer critiques at a glance.
* Sublime Text : This will be my primary text editor (unless another one turns out to be better) because I am most comfortable/familiar with it at this point.
* Sequel Pro : will be used to create a local database which will then be uploaded to the live host via MyPHPAdmin.
* MyPHPAdmin : used to update/maintain the database for the site.
* SourceTree : the desktop GUI for github to update my repository as I go along.
* MAMP : used to create a local host version of the site for quick testing/updates/development.
* FileZilla : used to upload/update site files from my local computer to the live site/web host.
* Web browsers : I'll crosscheck my work on Safari, Chrome and Firefox. Because I have access to an iMac, Macbook Pro, iPad and iPhone I will be focused primarily on those devices/dimensions, but allow for Android and PC as well as time permits (use PCs at work, so I can check things on IE 11 there).
* Web host : I'll create a live version of the site on Bluehost, creating a sub domain on my personal website so that I can properly check the site across several devices.
* WordPress : might possibly be used depending on the site that is being modified to be mobile.
* Languages/code used : HTML, CSS, PHP (?), MySQL (?), jQuery (?), Javascript (?)
* Primary local computer used : 2011 MacBook Pro running Intel core i7, OSX 10.8.5. If heavy design work is needed in InDesign or Photoshop, I may also use my 2008 iMac, which is running OSX 10.7.
